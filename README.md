## AlphaZero-Go Binyan 徐彬琰 2173214263
This is an implementation of the AlphaZero algorithm for playing 5*5 go game from pure self-play training. The go game here is specially designed to simplify this problem, so that we can focus on the training scheme of AlphaZero and obtain a pretty good AI model on a PC in a few hours.

### Requirements
To play with the trained AI models, only need:
- Python >= 3.7
- Numpy >= 1.20
As dependencies, read.py and write.py should be included in this directory to process .txt input & output.

To train the whole model from scratch, further need:
- PyTorch >= 0.2.0

```

### Getting Started
To run a deployed model, run the following script with Git Bash from '/Validing' directory:  
```
sh build.sh
```
Modify the 'play_time' variable in line 96 of the build.sh file to change the number of battles, and modify the random_player in line 36 of 'ta_agent=("random_player")' to another file script name to change the program that you play against

To play with provided models, run the following script from '/Training' directory:  
```
python human_play.py  
```
You may modify human_play.py to try different provided models or the pure MCTS.

To train the AI model from scratch with PyTorch, run the following script from '/Training' directory:  
```
python train.py
```
The models (best_policy.model and current_policy.model) will be saved every a few updates (default 50).  

### Some Explainations
my_player.py doesn't use any off-the-shelf algorithms, all algorithms in my_player.py are build from scratch, so only few packages are used.
The following five packages are all build-in packages in Python:
    import random                    #Usage: give randomness to policy
    import time                      #Usage: count time to avoid time out
    import pickle                    #Usage: convert file into a byte stream for file i/o
    import copy                      #Usage: use deepcopy to copy variables
    import os                        #Usage: delete files
#The following package is additional package:
    import numpy as np               #Usage: mathematical computation
#The following files are dependencies:
    from read import readInput       #Usage: get input
    from write import writeOutput    #Usage: get output
